        Classes are used to group HTML elements together and apply common styles or behaviors to them.they are important because:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> They allow you to apply the same styles or behaviour to multiple elements across your website.</li>
    <li>they promote consistency in design by ensuring that elements with the same class have a consistent look and behavior.</li>
